# Business-Insight-360

**Project Overview**

This project was developed as part of the Power BI course at Codebasics and aims to provide a comprehensive, integrated business intelligence solution for AtliQ, a rapidly growing global company. AtliQ faced significant challenges in managing and analyzing its operational data due to its reliance on Excel spreadsheets for data analytics. The project involved transitioning their data analysis capabilities to Power BI, enabling real-time, actionable insights across multiple business domains to drive data-driven decision-making.

**Problem Statement**

AtliQ, a business with operations expanding across multiple countries, was struggling with the increasing complexity of its operations. Despite their rapid growth, the company was relying heavily on Excel for data analysis, which was time-consuming, error-prone, and lacked scalability. This caused inefficiencies in decision-making and led to significant financial losses, particularly in their Latin American market, due to the inability to extract meaningful insights from their data in real time.

**Objectives**

The primary objective of this project was to transition AtliQ from its outdated Excel-based data analysis process to a more efficient and scalable solution: Power BI. The goal was to develop an interactive, dynamic, and integrated Power BI dashboard capable of providing real-time insights, improving operational efficiency, and empowering decision-makers at all levels of the business with actionable data.
